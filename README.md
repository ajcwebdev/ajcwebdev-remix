# Example Project from [A First Look at Remix](https://dev.to/ajcwebdev/a-first-look-at-remix-2cp1)

## Deployment

You can deploy your app by [importing a Git repository](https://vercel.com/new) into Vercel or if you'd like to avoid using a Git repository, you can directly deploy the project with the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli):

```bash
yarn vercel
```

It is generally recommended to use a Git repository, because future commits will then automatically be deployed by Vercel, through its [Git Integration](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/git).

## Development

To run your Remix app locally, make sure your project's local dependencies are installed:

```bash
yarn
```

Afterwards, start the Remix development server like so:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open up [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
